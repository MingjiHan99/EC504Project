## <u>VEB Tree Implementation for Ordered Dictionary


This VEB Tree implementation for ordered dictionary supports key-value pairs. 

- The ```insert``` method inserts a new key-value pair into the tree. If the key already exists in the tree, the associated value is updated.

- The ```delete``` method removes the key-value pair with the given key from the tree.

- The ```lookup``` method searches for a key-value pair with the given key by traversing the tree.

- The ```VEB_max``` and ```VEB_min``` methods find the maxmium and minimum values of the VEB tree and its children.

- The ```VEB_successor``` method return the next key that exists in the VEB tree.

Again, this implementation assumes that the keys are comparable.

#### <u>Usage

To run a Python file, follow these steps:

Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and navigate to the directory containing the Python file you want to run. For example:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your-python-file
Run the Python file using the following command, replacing your_python_file.py with the name of your Python file:

Copy code
python your_python_file.py
